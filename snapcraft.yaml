description: |
    GElectrical is a graphical frontend to pandapower for power supply simulation and analysis with emphasis on electrical distribution and utilisation networks. Following features are currently implemented.

    * Schematic capture.
    * Pandapower network generation from schematic.
    * Power flow time series analysis (Symmetric and Assymetric).
    * Voltage drop analysis.
    * Short circuit analysis (Symmetric and SLG).
    * Coordination analysis for power supply protection devices with support for CB and fuse protection curves; damage curves for transformers, cables and motors.
    * Support for daily load curves for load elements.
    * Support for arriving network parameters for custom geometry OH lines.
    * Electrical rules check for checking conformity with IEC/ local electrical guidelines.
    * Print and export of drawings to pdf.
    * Generation of analysis reports.
