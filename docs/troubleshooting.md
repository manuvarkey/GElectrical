# Troubleshooting

1. Unable to save value of fields in `Properties` tab. A symbol is displayed when field is modified.

> When a field is edited, it is not immedietly saved. After editing any field, the value can be saved by pressing `Enter` (`Ctrl`+`Enter` for multiline fields).

2. While inserting certain elements like `Grid`, ` Generator`, `Load` etc, the `Cycle Port` option do not seem to have any effect.

> These elements are single port elements. Hence cycle ports will not change the attachment point and this behaviour is expected..
