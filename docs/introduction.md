# Introduction

## General

GElectrical is a free and opensource electrical system analysis software for LV/MV electrical distribution networks. Following features are currently implemented.

* Schematic capture.
* Pandapower network generation from schematic.
* Power flow time series analysis (Symmetric and Assymetric).
* Power flow with diversity factors (Symmetric and Assymetric).
* Voltage drop analysis.
* Short circuit analysis (Symmetric and SLG).
* Coordination analysis for power supply protection devices with support for CB and fuse protection curves; damage curves for transformers, cables and motors.
* Support for daily load curves for load elements.
* Support for arriving network parameters for custom geometry OH lines.
* Support for modeling networks with mixed TN-S/ TN-C/ TT/ IT earthing systems.
* Electrical rules check for checking conformity with IEC/ local electrical guidelines.
* Print and export of drawings to pdf.
* Generation of analysis reports.
