    The two key features are the :func:`redo` and :func:`undo` methods. If an 
    exception occurs during doing or undoing a undoable, the undoable
    aborts and the stack is cleared to avoid any further data corruption. 
    
    The stack provides two properties for tracking actions: *docallback* 
    and *undocallback*. Each of these allow a callback function to be set
    which is called when an action is done or undone repectively. By default, 
    they do nothing.
    
    >>> def done():
    ...     print('Can now undo: {}'.format(stack().undotext()))
    >>> def undone():
    ...     print('Can now redo: {}'.format(stack().redotext()))
    >>> stack().docallback = done
    >>> stack().undocallback = undone

    ... def action():
    ...     yield 'An action'
    >>> action()
    Can now undo: Undo An action
    >>> stack().undo()
    Can now redo: Redo An action
    >>> stack().redo()
    Can now undo: Undo An action
    
    Setting them back to ``lambda: None`` will stop any further actions.
    
    >>> stack().docallback = stack().undocallback = lambda: None
    >>> action()
    >>> stack().undo()
    
    It is possible to mark a point in the undo history when the document
    handled is saved. This allows the undo system to report whether a 
    document has changed. The point is marked using :func:`savepoint` and
    :func:`haschanged` returns whether or not the state has changed (either
    by doing or undoing an action). Only one savepoint can be tracked,
    marking a new one removes the old one.
